# Spring-Mass-System-Simulation
This is a real physics simulation of a spring-mass system with variable floor friction, amplitude, mass, and spring constant. 
Euler's method was used to solve ODE's of damped spring-mass system motion:

Implemented with simple GUI. This includes run, pause, reset buttons and animated graphs. The animated graphs show the kinetic energy given by:

as well as the mass position just derived by the ODE of motion graphed for each instant of time.
All python was used for this project was from the Vpython module which allows for clean 3d graphics.
